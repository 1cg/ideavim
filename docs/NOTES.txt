@NAME@ version @VERSION@ Release Notes

VIM Emulator plugin for IntelliJ IDEA. See the enclosed README file in the
binary distribution for installation instructions. See docs/vim/index.txt for
a complete list of supported VIM commands. This release has been tested with
IDEA 3.0.2 (build #695), 3.0.3 (build #698), and 3.0.4 (build #701) but may
work with other 3.0 releases. Limited testing indicates the plugin works just
fine under Aurora.
