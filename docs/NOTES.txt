@NAME@ version @VERSION@ Release Notes for IDEA @IDEA-VERSION@

Ctrl-K is being used for the first time and it appears this is mapped to
several source control menus. In order to resolve this you must either
install the updated Vim.xml into the keymaps directory or unmap Ctrl-K from
all source control menus. This is accomplished as follows:

- Select File|Settings menus.
- Click on the Keymap icon.
- Ensure Vim is the active keymap.
- Expand the 'Other' node under the keymap tree.
- Scroll down to the entry labeld 'Keys' and select it.
- Click on 'Add Keyboard Shortcut...'
- Type 'Ctrl-K' in the first key field.
- You may see a message about conflicts.
- Click OK to save the Ctrl-K shortcut.
- If there was a conflict you will get a Warning dialog. Select 'Remove' to
  remove the conflicts.
- Click OK in the key mapping dialog.
- Click Close in the settings dialog.
