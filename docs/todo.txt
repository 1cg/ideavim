Bugs to fix:

- can't delete empty lines at end of file.
- cw on last word of file removes last word but moves cursor to start of
  previous line.
- Replace mode - fix cursor. Can't figure out how to keep block cursor.

Requested Functionality to add:

- More fold region support
- Window support (need access to splitter)
- Text objects (visual and operator modes)
