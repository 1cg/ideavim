Bugs to fix:

- :dig doesn't bring up the window (it flashes a split second).
- Toggling plugin doesn't restore proper order of shortcuts for actions.
- Split text when typing fast after o command.
- Replace mode - fix caret. Can't figure out how to keep block caret.
- Repeating a last change doesn't include text inserted by IDEA using code
  completion.

Requested Functionality to add:

- Show message after shifting lines with :< or :>
- Visual Column mode
- / and ? as command operators
