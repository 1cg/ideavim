Bugs to fix:

- Split text when typing fast after o command.
- Replace mode - fix caret. Can't figure out how to keep block caret.
- Repeating a last change doesn't include text inserted by IDEA using code
  completion.

Requested Functionality to add:

- Show message after shifting lines with :< or :>
- / and ? as command operators
