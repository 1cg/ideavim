Bugs to fix:

- Disable commands not appropriate for one-line editors in dialogs.
- c in dialog causes exception.
- Ctrl-/ doesn't move the cursor down a line after commenting the line.
- Searches are very slow on big files.
- :dig doesn't bring up the window (it flashes a split second).
- Split text when typing fast after o command.
- Replace mode - fix caret. Can't figure out how to keep block caret.
- Repeating a last change doesn't include text inserted by IDEA using code
  completion.

Requested Functionality to add:

- Add Config GUI to choose IDEA vs. VIM function for keystrokes
- Support Select mode
- Show message after shifting lines with :< or :>
- / and ? as command operators
