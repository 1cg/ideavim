Bugs to fix:

- Fix mouse wheel scrolling and scrolloff value
- Split text when typing fast after o command.
- Show message after shifting lines with :< or :>
- Replace mode - fix cursor. Can't figure out how to keep block cursor.
- Visual mode not exited after executing non-vim key command. See below.

Requested Functionality to add:

- Support for 'sidescroll', 'sidescrolloff' options
- Visual Column mode
- More fold region support
- Window support (need access to splitter)
- / and ? as command operators

o Visual mode not ended after edit command

 Visual mode is not ended when applying the 'comment
 block' editing action, as I think it should be.

 To repeat:

 v
 [select text]
 Ctrl-Shift-/
 [movement command]
