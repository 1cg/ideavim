Bugs to fix:

- Split text when typing fast after o command.
- Show message after shifting lines with :< or :>
- Replace mode - fix cursor. Can't figure out how to keep block cursor.

Requested Functionality to add:

- Visual Column mode
- More fold region support
- Window support (need access to splitter)
