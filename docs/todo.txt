Bugs to fix:

- b when on start of punctuation.
- :<range><command> can't have a space before the command.
- <count>e and <count>b on 1/2/3 doesn't work right.
- 5dw on /1/2/3 deletes way too much.
- can't delete empty lines at end of file.
- Show message after shifting lines with :< or :>
- Replace mode - fix cursor. Can't figure out how to keep block cursor.

Requested Functionality to add:

- Compose support for i18n
- More fold region support
- Window support (need access to splitter)
- Text objects (visual and operator modes)
