Bugs to fix:

- g^, g0, g$, g<Home>, g<End> should work on screen, not whole line.
- :dig doesn't bring up the window (it flashes a split second).
- Split text when typing fast after o command.
- Replace mode - fix caret. Can't figure out how to keep block caret.
- Repeating a last change doesn't include text inserted by IDEA using code
  completion.

Requested Functionality to add:

- Add Config GUI to choose IDEA vs. VIM function for keystrokes
- Show message after shifting lines with :< or :>
- / and ? as command operators
