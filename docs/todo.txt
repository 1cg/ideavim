Bugs to fix:

- Replace mode - fix cursor and use of Insert key.
- r<Enter> doesn't work as expected.
- In split mode - selections should be same in both.
- Yanking/putting on last line of file not quite right.
- Repeating (via .) the O command affects prior line of text.

Requested Functionality to add:

- More fold region support
- Window support (need access to splitter)
- Text objects (visual and operator modes)
